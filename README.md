# Real-Time Meeting Transcription

A Node.js application that connects to video meetings (Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) and provides real-time audio transcription using MeetingBaas and Gladia APIs.

## Features

- Joins video conferences as a bot participant
- Streams audio from meetings to Gladia for real-time transcription
- Logs transcriptions with speaker detection
- Provides clean shutdown with proper resource cleanup
- Supports multiple video conferencing platforms through MeetingBaas

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)
- MeetingBaas API key
- Gladia API key
- Ngrok or similar tool for exposing local webhook endpoints

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-meeting-transcription.git
   cd real-time-meeting-transcription
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   MEETING_BAAS_API_KEY=your_meetingbaas_api_key
   GLADIA_API_KEY=your_gladia_api_key
   PROXY_HOST=0.0.0.0
   PROXY_PORT=3000
   ```

## Usage

1. Start ngrok to create a public URL for your webhook:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

   Note the https URL that ngrok provides (e.g., https://abcd-123-456-789.ngrok-free.app).

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev <meeting_url> <bot_name> <ngrok_url>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev https://us06web.zoom.us/j/12345?pwd=abcdef "Transcription Bot" https://abcd-123-456-789.ngrok-free.app
   ```

3. The bot will join the meeting and begin transcribing audio in real-time.

4. To stop the transcription service, press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal. The application will gracefully shutdown.

## Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1. **MeetingBaas Client** (`src/meetingbaas.ts`): Handles communication with the MeetingBaas API, which provides the bot service that joins meetings and streams audio.

2. **Proxy Server** (`src/proxy.ts`): A WebSocket server that acts as a bridge between MeetingBaas and Gladia. It receives audio from MeetingBaas and forwards it to Gladia, then captures transcriptions from Gladia.

3. **Gladia Client** (`src/gladia.ts`): Manages the connection to Gladia's real-time transcription API.

Data flow:

1. MeetingBaas bot joins a meeting via API
2. Audio from the meeting is sent to your webhook URL (ngrok)
3. The proxy server receives this audio and forwards it to Gladia
4. Gladia transcribes the audio and returns the transcription
5. The transcription is logged and can be processed further as needed

## Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized Error**: Verify your MeetingBaas API key is correct in the `.env` file.
- **WebSocket Connection Issues**: Make sure your ngrok URL is correct and the proxy server is running.
- **No Audio Transcription**: Check that Gladia API key is valid and the WebSocket connection is established.
- **Bot Not Joining Meeting**: Ensure the meeting URL is valid and accessible without additional authentication.

## Configuration

The application can be configured via the `src/config.ts` file or environment variables:

- `MEETING_BAAS_API_KEY`: Your MeetingBaas API key
- `GLADIA_API_KEY`: Your Gladia API key
- `PROXY_HOST`: Host for the proxy server (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `PROXY_PORT`: Port for the proxy server (default: 3000)
- `MEETING_BAAS_API_URL`: MeetingBaas API URL (default: https://api.meetingbaas.com)
